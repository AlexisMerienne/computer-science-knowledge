# Software Architecture Essentials (C++ Focus)

This course is a complete, modular lecture series on software architecture with a C++ focus.

Files in this folder:

- `00-Overview.md` — Course overview and navigation
- `Module-01-Introduction.md` ... `Module-08-CaseStudies.md` — Module content

Each module contains theoretical notes, practical guidance, C++ examples, diagrams, and navigation links to the previous and next modules.

This repository previously included a small runnable example. The example directory has been removed — if you want a starter scaffold for the final project we can add one on request.

Related material in this workspace:

- [C++ Refresher for Software Developers](../cpp/00-Overview.md) — a focused set of modules covering modern C++ features, memory management, design patterns, performance, testing, and a practical project.
