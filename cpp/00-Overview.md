# C++ Refresher for Software Developers

This collection covers a compact, practical refresher on modern C++ (including C++11/14/17/20/23). Each module focuses on important topics with examples, idioms, and short exercises.

Course Objectives

- Refresh core and advanced C++ concepts
- Reinforce modern C++ features and idioms
- Review software architecture principles and design patterns in C++
- Optimize performance, memory usage, and maintainability
- Practice debugging, testing, and profiling techniques
